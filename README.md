# MvcFormsUsersAndRoles
Starter project for ASP.NET Identity with Roles and not much more.
This is a form of the NuGet Package 
[Microsoft ASP.NET Identity Samples 2.1.0-alpha1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Samples/2.1.0-alpha1)'s 
output project. 

The major difference: I take out everything that doesn't have anything to do with roles. No 2 factor, FB, G+, etc. logins, etc.
##Dream
Someday make this into a NuGet package or Project Template.
