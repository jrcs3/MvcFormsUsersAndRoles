# MvcFormsUsersAndRoles
Starter project for ASP.NET Identity with Roles and not much more.
This is a form of the NuGet Package 
[Microsoft ASP.NET Identity Samples 2.1.0-alpha1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Samples/2.1.0-alpha1)'s 
output project. 

The major difference: I take out everything that doesn't have anything to do with roles. No 2 factor, FB, G+, etc. logins, etc.

## Blog
I write about this in my blog: [VS Item Template for ASP.NET Identity 2.0](http://brochure.jrcs3.com/2016/06/vs-item-template-for-aspnet-identity-20.html)

## Dream (that will never come true)
Someday make this into a NuGet package or Project Template.

## Update
I upgraded this project to .NET Framework 4.8 to stop getting Dependabot nag emails.
